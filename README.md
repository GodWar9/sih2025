# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Getting Started

1.  **Set up your Gemini API Key:**
    *   Open the `.env` file in the root of the project.
    *   Replace `"your-api-key-here"` with your actual Gemini API key.

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the application on your local machine.
