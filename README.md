# Smart Classroom and Timetable Scheduler
This project is an innovative web application designed to modernize educational management through smart technology integration. It features a secure, role-based login using JWT authentication, catering to teachers, students, and admins with personalized dashboards.

Key functionalities include dynamic timetable scheduling powered by AI algorithms that efficiently allocate classes, handle cancellations, classroom capacity, and student conflicts. Teachers have the ability to confirm their lectures, while students can easily add elective courses to their schedules.

Real-time notifications keep all users informed about lecture updates and changes, ensuring smooth communication and minimizing disruptions. The user interface is built with Bootstrap, providing a responsive and intuitive experience across devices, with clearly structured navigation through the dashboard, timetable, notifications, and review & approval panels.

This system aims to streamline classroom scheduling, enhance communication, and provide a flexible, interactive learning environment that adapts quickly to changes, making it an ideal solution for modern educational institutions.
